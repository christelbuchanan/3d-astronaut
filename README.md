# ChatAndBuild Space Journey

An interactive 3D web experience that takes users on a journey through space with an astronaut, featuring immersive animations and scroll-based storytelling.

## Features

- Immersive 3D space environment with dynamic stars and nebula effects
- Scroll-based animations and transitions
- Interactive astronaut character that guides users through the experience
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Arcade-style typography and minimalist UI

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Animation**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatandbuild-space-journey.git
   cd chatandbuild-space-journey
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

The experience is divided into several sections that are revealed as the user scrolls:

1. **Intro Section**: The astronaut floats in space, introducing the experience
2. **Tunnel Section**: The astronaut approaches and enters a digital tunnel
3. **Breakout Section**: The astronaut breaks through a digital barrier
4. **Content Section**: The main content of the site is revealed

The animations are synchronized with the scroll position using GSAP's ScrollTrigger, while the 3D elements are rendered using React Three Fiber.

## Customization

### Modifying the Space Environment

The space environment can be customized by editing the `SpaceEnvironment.tsx` file. You can adjust:

- Star count, colors, and distribution
- Nebula colors and opacity
- Light positions and intensities

### Changing the Astronaut

The astronaut model is defined in `Astronaut.tsx`. You can modify:

- Body proportions and colors
- Animation behavior
- Lighting effects

## Performance Considerations

- The application uses instanced geometry for stars to improve performance
- Animations are optimized to run at 60fps on most devices
- 3D elements are conditionally rendered based on visibility

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
